Exercise 46:

Construct a program defining a vector<unsigned> having 10 elements. Use iota to fill these elements with, subsequently, the values
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18.

> We create a wrapper class `UEven' that wraps an unsigned value.
It overrides `operator++' to increment the data twice when called, resulting in an even number.
It also has a conversion op `operator unsigned const &()' which returns the inner unsigned data when used as rvalue.
When called with `std::iota', the initial value is given as a `UEven' obj initialized to zero. 
Thus, when filling up the values of vector, the `operator++' of `UEven' is called, and successive even numbers are inserted
by rvalue conversion operator to the vector fields.

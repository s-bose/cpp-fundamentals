Exercise 45:

Learn to recognize a situation where lambda functions may be used.

In this exercise, we are tasked to rewrite the `count' and `countChar' member functions of `Vstring' using Generic algorithms and Lambda expressions.

In case of `countChar', we can utilize `std::accumulate' to accumulate the count of accepted chars for each string.
In case of `count', as per the statement, we use `for_each' which adds to the `n_accepted' the accepted count for each string processed.

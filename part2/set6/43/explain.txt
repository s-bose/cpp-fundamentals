Exercise 43:

Learn to sort fields in POD or comparable structs/classes.

In this exercise, we have to sort a vector of Student POD struct first by their last names, case-insensitively.
Which we are able to do by calling `std::sort' with a lambda function that uses `std::strcasecmp' C-function to compare two strings
case-insensitively.

Then we indirectly sort the vector by manipulating an auxiliary vector containing the indices of its elements, and sorting
the indices according to the student Number.

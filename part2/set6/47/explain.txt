Exercise 47:

Define copyFile functions either expecting two filenames using fundamentally different ways to copy source to dest.

Addendum:

In the previous attempt, the fstream objects used for reading/writing the files were being manually closed, which is unnecessary.
The file handlers automatically call their destructors which release all their resources when they go out of scope.

Exercise 47:

Define copyFile functions either expecting two filenames using fundamentally different ways to copy source to dest.

Addendum:

In the previous attempt, the fstream objects used for reading/writing the files were being manually closed, which is unnecessary.
The file handlers automatically call their destructors which release all their resources when they go out of scope.
In addition, one implementation using char buffer previously used the full-length of the input stream which is now changed to use
a fixed-size buffer.
A new implementation has been added to copy using `get' & `put' one char at-a-time.

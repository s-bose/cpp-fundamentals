Exercise 59:

Learn to inspect one or more futures from inside a repeat-statement, even if the future has not yet been made ready.

> For a single thread, we can repeatedly poll the returned future object to see if its status is ready.

Describe the required modifications if you run multiple threads.

> For multiple threads, we can create an array or vector of their returned future objects and iterate over
the array to check if the status is ready.

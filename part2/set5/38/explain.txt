Exercise 38:

Learn to define a class whose data are elsewhere.

In this exercise, class Lines should read lines of text from an istream in its constructor. The instances
have functions to retrieve line strings for that instance and other instances.

We use a global std::map with Lines pointers as key_type, and vector<string> objects as value_types.
At the Lines constructor, each line from the stream is put to a local vector until an empty newline (start of 
new object), and inserted to the map associated with `this' pointer.

To access the n-th Lines obj's contents, we use std::next to iterate n times starting from map::begin() and retrieve
the corresponding vector.

At destruction, the vector associated to `this' is removed.

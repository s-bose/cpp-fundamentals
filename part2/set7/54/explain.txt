Exercise 54:

Learn to sort out the mess that output may become in the face of threads.

METHOD 1 is used. In order to make all insertions to a TSosWrap separate from other TSosWrap, we make
use of a shared_mutex.

TSosWrap has a public static shared_mutex instance. Before inserting, f2 tries to acquire a unique lock on the
shared_mutex, and if successful, it will write its line into the stream uninterrupted, then f1 similarly writes
its lines uninterrupted, finally the lock is released (RAII) for other threads so no conflict arises.

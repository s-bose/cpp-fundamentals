Exercise 52:

Learn to design a simple producer/consumer program.

The Storage class is a singleton class implemented using std::call_once & provides thread-safe push() & pop() functions.
push() locks the queue and pushes a string.
pop() locks the queue, copies the string at front & pops the queue.

A producer thread (main), pushes each line from std::cin, and signals that it's done by setting d_finished
flag inside Storage class.

A consumer thread polls the singleton Storage queue every second to check if the queue is empty & pops from the
queue and writes it to a file, until the producer is finished.

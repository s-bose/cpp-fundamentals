Exercise 49:

This exercise is about learning to apply basic multi-threading. 
We create a thread that print a dot each second and let it run in the background,
while the main thread calculates prime numbers via the sieve method.

**Addendum**
In the previous submission, we detached the thread running the dots, which was
unnecessary. Instead, we created a function object with a stop flag that is set by
the main thread after prime finding to stop printing the dots and join the dots thread.

Exercise 01:

Hello world program in C++

Provide short descriptions of what Object files and Executables
are:

Object file is the binary file generated after compilation containing 
external references to functions, objects or classes in other libraries 
or object files.

When a source file containing a main function gets compiled and its 
object file gets linked with all the external libraries and additional 
object files it is referring to, the resulting binary that can be 
executed as a program is called an Executable.

Files:
 1. hello.cc       - C++ source file
 2. hello.o        - object file after compilation of `hello.cc`
 3. hello          - executable file after linking of `hello.o`

Commands:

1. compile hello.cc into object file hello.o

g++ -c hello.cc -Wall -Werror -std=c++2a 


1. link `hello.o` and iostream library
   generate executable `hello`
   strip executable

g++ -o hello hello.o -Wall -Werror -std=c++2a && strip -s hello

Sizes (in Bytes):

1. hello.cc (Source file)            -- 76 Bytes
2. hello.o (Object file)             -- 2648 Bytes
3. hello (Executable, striped)       -- 14464 Bytes
4. iostream file                     -- 2695 Bytes

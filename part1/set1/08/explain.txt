Exercise 8:

Replace a nibble with another using bit manipulation.

The offset of the nibble to be replaced is multiplied with 4 to start 
from the first bit of the nibble.

15 is shifted to the position of the replaced nibble, then flipped by 
xor-ing with size_t max (obtained by 1's complementing and OR-ing 1) 
to reset the nibble's bits to 0, then OR-ed with the replacement 
(also shifted to nibble position) to replace the bits.

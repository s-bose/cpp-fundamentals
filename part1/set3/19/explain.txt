Exercise 19:

Implement wc program to count characters, words, lines from input stream.

In our previous submission there were multiple issues with the functions'
implementations.
In addition, the confusion about .ih headers is resolved and it now
contains one main.h header containing all the forward declarations, and
an internal header main.ih including main.h and other libraries needed
by the function implementations.

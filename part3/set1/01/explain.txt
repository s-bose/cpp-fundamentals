Exercise 1:

Show that templates don't result in `code bloat'
Show in a small example that template functions instantiated for the same type, 
but in different source files will eventually be linked as a single function in the final executable program. 

**Addendum**
We have changed the naming convention of the function pointer members in the unions.
In addition, we created separate source files containing the different instantiations of the template which are
to be linked to main.

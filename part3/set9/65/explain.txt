Exercise 65:

learn to expand a grammar in a substantial way.
Add all standard C++ arithmetic operators to the parser.

The multichar operators are categorized into three categories, 
OP_ASSiGN: "."= (not including below)
OP_COMP:   ==, !=, <=, >=
OP_LOGIC:  ||, &&
OP_SHIFT:  <<, >>

The scanner returns these generic group tokens and holds a `d_operator' 
string holding the distinguishing part of the op to be looked up in a
symbol table `s_symbols' to retrieve a unique token for that op.

Parser processes that token to obtain an index to an array of func ptrs,
which then executes the corresponding operation.

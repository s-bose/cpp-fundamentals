Exercise 64:

learn to expand an existing grammar with new commands.
Add commands quit and exit to the parser's grammar, so that when these words are entered, 
the parser stops. Also, implement list showing the alphabetically ordered list of all 
defined variables, including their values.

In order to produce a sorted list of defined variables, the internal `d_symtab' storing
pairs of identifiers and their indices to their semantic value (vector `d_value') has
been changed from std::unordered_map to std::map.

Exercise 62:

learn to repair a defective grammar.
In the slides the wordlist grammar having one R/R conflict was discussed.
1. Repair the orgininal grammar:

%% 

input:
|
    // empty
|
    input line
;

line:
    plain
|
    separated
;

plain:
    plain WORD
|
    WORD
;

separated:
    word_comma WORD
;

word_comma:
    WORD ','
|
    separated ','
;

2. show what must be altered to make even that initial word optional.

there can be an additional empty production rule for `line'
i.e.

line:
    plain
|
    separated
|
    // empty
;

to make the initial word optional. Further words can be introduced by either
the `plain' or `separated' rule from the recursion of `input ::= input line'.

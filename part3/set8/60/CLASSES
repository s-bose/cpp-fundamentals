# This file is used by icmbuild(1) and should contain the names of all
# 1-level deep sub-directories containing sources to compile. Each directory
# should be specified on a line of its own. Initial blanks are ok. 

# If a parser or scanner is used, (see icmconf's USE_PARSER and USE_SCANNER
# defines) then those directories are automatically included (they
# may be included here as well) 

# Lines starting with # or with // are ignored, as are empty lines.

# Sources in the current directory (i.e., the directory containing CLASSES) 
# are also compiled, but should be avoided unless the MAIN directive is
# specified in the icmconf file.

# Class dependencies are handled by icm_dep, called from icmake using option
# -d (enter   icmake -d   for short usage info, or see the section on icm_dep 
# in the icmake(1) and icmbuild(1)'s man-pages.

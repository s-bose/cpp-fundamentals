Exercise 17:

Learn to design a simple trait class.

**Addendum**
In previous submission, and many other exercises, the #includes for basic types like size_t were <iosfwd> which was unnecessary.
That has been changed to <cstddef>.
The bool `even' and `by3' evaluations have been changed from `not (Nr % 2)' to `Nr % 2 == 0'.
Instead of using log10, a separate consteval static function has been created to calculate the number width in compile-time.

Exercise 49:

The following program takes in text via stdin or files if any arguments are
passed and outputs the unique words to stdout. The flexc++ scanner generator
was used to generate the Scanner and ScannerBase classes. We modified Scanner
and added the Tokens enum.

scannerbase.h, scanner.ih and lex.cc were omitted from order.txt file nothing
was modified and they take up space on the pdf.
